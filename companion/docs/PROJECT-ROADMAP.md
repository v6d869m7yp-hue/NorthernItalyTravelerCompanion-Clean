# Project Roadmap

## Stable baseline
- v6.8.1 is the last user-confirmed functional baseline.
- v6.8.4 adds only foundation, diagnostics, and release controls.

## Required before finished product
1. Complete Istanbul, Viking, port, and post-cruise content.
2. Implement and prove automatic device-encrypted Vault synchronization through Firebase.
3. Preserve manual encrypted backups to iCloud Drive as an independent recovery path.
4. Complete multi-device, offline, lost-device, and restore testing.
5. Pass the full regression checklist with no critical failures.

## Release rule
No feature is complete until demonstrated in the deployed application.

## v7.2.3 — Encrypted Vault Sync (Stage 1)
- Automatic encrypted snapshot sync while unlocked
- Manual sync and download controls
- Firebase stores ciphertext only
- Multi-device setup requires restoring the same Vault backup on each device
- Conflict hardening and full device-revocation remain release gates before v1.0
